# List Invoices

Returns a list of invoices for a given location. The response
is paginated. If truncated, the response includes a `cursor` that you  
use in a subsequent request to retrieve the next set of invoices.

```php
function listInvoices(string $locationId, ?string $cursor = null, ?int $limit = null): ApiResponse
```

## Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Tags | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `locationId` | `string` | Query, Required | The ID of the location for which to list invoices. |
| `cursor` | `?string` | Query, Optional | A pagination cursor returned by a previous call to this endpoint.<br>Provide this cursor to retrieve the next set of results for your original query.<br><br>For more information, see [Pagination](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/build-basics/common-api-patterns/pagination). |
| `limit` | `?int` | Query, Optional | The maximum number of invoices to return (200 is the maximum `limit`).<br>If not provided, the server uses a default limit of 100 invoices. |

## Response Type

This method returns a `Square\Utils\ApiResponse` instance. The `getResult()` method on this instance returns the response data which is of type [`ListInvoicesResponse`](../../doc/models/list-invoices-response.md).

## Example Usage

```php
$locationId = 'location_id4';

$apiResponse = $invoicesApi->listInvoices($locationId);

if ($apiResponse->isSuccess()) {
    $listInvoicesResponse = $apiResponse->getResult();
} else {
    $errors = $apiResponse->getErrors();
}

// Getting more response information
var_dump($apiResponse->getStatusCode());
var_dump($apiResponse->getHeaders());
```


# Create Invoice

Creates a draft [invoice](../../doc/models/invoice.md)
for an order created using the Orders API.

A draft invoice remains in your account and no action is taken.
You must publish the invoice before Square can process it (send it to the customer's email address or charge the customer’s card on file).

```php
function createInvoice(CreateInvoiceRequest $body): ApiResponse
```

## Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Tags | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `body` | [`CreateInvoiceRequest`](../../doc/models/create-invoice-request.md) | Body, Required | An object containing the fields to POST for the request.<br><br>See the corresponding object definition for field details. |

## Response Type

This method returns a `Square\Utils\ApiResponse` instance. The `getResult()` method on this instance returns the response data which is of type [`CreateInvoiceResponse`](../../doc/models/create-invoice-response.md).

# Update Invoice

Updates an invoice by modifying fields, clearing fields, or both. For most updates, you can use a sparse
`Invoice` object to add fields or change values and use the `fields_to_clear` field to specify fields to clear.
However, some restrictions apply. For example, you cannot change the `order_id` or `location_id` field and you
must provide the complete `custom_fields` list to update a custom field. Published invoices have additional restrictions.

# Publish Invoice

Publishes the specified draft invoice.

After an invoice is published, Square
follows up based on the invoice configuration. For example, Square
sends the invoice to the customer's email address, charges the customer's card on file, or does
nothing. Square also makes the invoice available on a Square-hosted invoice page.

The invoice `status` also changes from `DRAFT` to a status
based on the invoice configuration. For example, the status changes to `UNPAID` if
Square emails the invoice or `PARTIALLY_PAID` if Square charge a card on file for a portion of the
invoice amount.

```php
function publishInvoice(string $invoiceId, PublishInvoiceRequest $body): ApiResponse
```

## Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Tags | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `invoiceId` | `string` | Template, Required | The ID of the invoice to publish. |
